Dungeons of Daggorath
PC-Port Version 0.4.0

------------

Unzip the tar.gz file, cd to the "src" directory and type the following commands:

make
cp dod ..

To run, type cd .. and ./dod

That's it!  If you want to make a shortcut to it, make sure that in the "execute" box of the short cut, you type (including the quotes):

"cd <directory>;dod"

where <directory> is the location of the unzipped dod executable

Enjoy, if you have any problems with the port please post to the daggorath discussion forum at http://mspencer.net/daggorath

Thanks
